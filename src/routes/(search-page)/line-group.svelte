  //   being read by a human, due to the page being too tall. We use a
  //   VisibilityObserver to highlight only code that's on the screen.
  // - "Only on the client" because CPU intensive tasks can smoke the server's
  //   performance. Node is great at lots of concurrent I/O, but anything CPU
  //   intensive that blocks its event loop from progressing quickly grinds
  //   things to a halt.
  //
  // The price to pay over doing highlighting on the server is that the client
  // has to download and execute some assets that are pretty enormous, compared
  // to everything else in the app. The baseline shiki bundle (their JS, the
  // oniguruma wasm blob, plus the theme we use) is something like 300kb
